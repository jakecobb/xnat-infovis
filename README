xnat-infovis :: xNAT Information Visualization Project

Developing in Eclipse
=====================

xnat-infovis is built with Maven.  You can setup for Eclipse by running:

$ mvn -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true eclipse:eclipse

Then use Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace.  If the pom.xml 
changes, you can rerun mvn eclipse:eclipse and then refresh the project.

Running Unit Tests in Eclipse
=============================

After setting up above, you need to get Maven to copy the resources 
once (or again after you've added new ones).  After that, you can 
run the JUnit tests in Eclipse as normal.  The copy command is:

$ mvn resources:resources resources:testResources
